# Stock-market-prediction
The aim of this project is to work and improvise the idea of analyzing and predicting the stock market using Deep learning techniques and Machine learning techniques. We’ll be using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm to predict the future stock behaviour. We’ll also be predicting the value we put into risk when investing in a particular stock.
